# pythook - Ook! interpreter in Python

Ook! is a joke esoteric programming language created by David Morgan-Mar. It is identical to Brainfuck, except that the instructions are changed into Orangutan words. It represents the first, although unfortunately not the last, in a long line of trivial Brainfuck command substitutions. As such, it is a member of the TrivialBrainfuckSubstitution family of programming languages. [[source](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Ook!)]
